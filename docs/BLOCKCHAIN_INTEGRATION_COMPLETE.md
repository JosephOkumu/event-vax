# ✅ Blockchain Integration Implementation Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update (`server/utils/database.js`)
- ✅ Added `blockchain_tx_hash` column to store transaction hash
- ✅ Added `blockchain_event_id` column to store on-chain event ID
- ✅ Updated `insertEvent` function to accept and store blockchain data

### 2. Event Creation (`src/pages/Myevent.jsx`)
- ✅ Extract `blockchain_event_id` from EventCreated event after transaction
- ✅ Store both transaction hash and event ID in database
- ✅ Proper error handling for user rejection vs actual errors
- ✅ Validation that event ID was successfully extracted

### 3. Ticket Purchase (`src/pages/MintNFT.jsx`)
- ✅ Use stored `blockchain_event_id` to fetch ticket contract address
- ✅ Call real `purchaseTicket` function on TicketNFT contract
- ✅ Send AVAX payment with transaction
- ✅ Wait for blockchain confirmation
- ✅ Store transaction hash and block number
- ✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## How It Works Now

### Event Creation Flow:
1. User fills out event form
2. Transaction sent to EventFactory.createEvent()
3. Wait for blockchain confirmation
4. Extract eventId from EventCreated event logs
5. Store event data + blockchain_event_id in database
6. Event is now ready for ticket sales

### Ticket Purchase Flow:
1. User selects event and ticket type
2. Fetch blockchain_event_id from database
3. Query EventFactory.eventTicket(eventId) to get TicketNFT contract
4. Call TicketNFT.purchaseTicket(tierId, quantity) with AVAX payment
5. Wait for blockchain confirmation
6. Store ticket data with transaction proof in database
7. User receives NFT tickets on-chain

## What's On-Chain vs Off-Chain

### ✅ On-Chain (Blockchain):
- Event creation timestamp
- Event metadata URI
- Ticket ownership (ERC1155 NFTs)
- Ticket purchases (with AVAX payment)
- Transaction history
- Ticket tier pricing
- Ticket supply limits

### 📝 Off-Chain (Database):
- Event descriptions and details
- Flyer images (base64)
- Venue information
- User-friendly event names
- QR code data
- Transaction hash references
- blockchain_event_id mapping

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Create Ticket Tiers After Event Creation**
   - Call `TicketNFT.createTiersBatch()` after event is created
   - Set max supply and pricing for Regular/VIP/VVIP tiers

2. **Add Ticket Verification**
   - Verify ticket ownership on-chain before entry
   - Check if ticket was already used via `usedTickets` mapping

3. **IPFS Integration**
   - Upload event metadata to IPFS
   - Store real IPFS hash instead of mock URI

4. **Resale Marketplace**
   - Integrate with Marketplace contract
   - Allow users to list tickets for resale

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new event and verify blockchain_event_id is stored
- [ ] Purchase ticket and verify AVAX is deducted
- [ ] Check ticket ownership on blockchain
- [ ] Verify transaction appears on Snowtrace
- [ ] Test with multiple ticket quantities
- [ ] Test user rejection handling
- [ ] Test with insufficient AVAX balance

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Database Migration Required**: Existing events in the database don't have `blockchain_event_id`. They won't work for ticket purchases until recreated.

⚠️ **Ticket Tiers Must Be Created**: After creating an event, the organizer must call `createTiersBatch()` to set up ticket pricing and supply before users can purchase.

⚠️ **Network**: Ensure MetaMask is connected to Avalanche Fuji Testnet (Chain ID: 43113)
